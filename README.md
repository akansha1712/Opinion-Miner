# Opinion-Miner
Project on Sentiment Analysis which makes good use of available python libraries. P.S - It is not a research based project.

The focus of the project is to retrieve and analyse the reviews of any product obtained from popular online shopping portals like amazon.com or snapdeal.com. In order to achieve this, we must satisfy the following requirements which are given along with the solutions employed. :
I.	Setting up of our own server – Python Flask
II.	Get the required html page – HTTP request
III.	Parse the received html page and extract review – Beautiful Soup 
IV.	Tokenizing each review – NLTK Punkt Tokenizer
V.	Parts of Speech tagging – NLTK
VI.	Sentiment analysis and Polarity determination - VaderSentiment
Hence, it can be seen that the project has completely been implemented in python so as to make good use of its available libraries and 3rd party modules.
